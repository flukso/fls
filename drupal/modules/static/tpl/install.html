            <p>Disconnect all cables from the FLM. Find a suitable location near the fuse box to install the FLM. Secure the FLM with a plastic cable tie or or use the rear mounting holes to fix the Fluksometer to the wall.</p>

            <p>Connect the cable from the current clamp to one of the FLM's current clamp ports (ports 1,2 or 3). Take care of connecting the black and red cable as shown in the drawing on the left.</p>

            <p>For safety reasons, switch off the main electricity supply. Within the fuse box, attach a current clamp to each of the live wires running from the electricity meter. Close the clamp firmly. You should hear a slight click. The lip should lie flush with the clamp's body.</p>
            <p><strong>For safety reasons, the live wire should be fully insulated. Never attach the clamp to a non-insulated live wire!</strong></p>

            <p>Switch the main electricity supply back on. Power up your FLM by connecting the power plug. Wait until a heartbeat is present on the heartbeat LED. Connect your computer to the FLM's LAN ethernet port. Surf to <a href = 'http://192.168.255.1'>http://192.168.255.1</a>. Sign in using the default user/password settings. On the network tab, select the proper wireless network and fill in the corresponding security key. The globe LED should light up within one minute. Proceed to the port page and configure each of the ports you wish to use on the FLM. For a proper configuration, make sure to set the correct electrical system, i.e. single-phase or 3-phase with(out) N. Before pressing the 'save' button, make sure PV-panels are temporarily disabled and that a sufficiently large electrical load is turned on.</p>
